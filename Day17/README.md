# Web_Development_Crash_Course_Day_17_Assignment

This is a basic React project created using Vite. It shows how to use React Router DOM to move between pages without refreshing the browser.

Pages Included
The app has three pages:

Home Page: Has links to About and Dashboard pages.

About Page: Shows simple information.

Dashboard Page: Shows feature data based on the ID given in the URL.

How Navigation Works
React Router DOM is used to set up routes. We use <Link> to create clickable links between pages. The Dashboard page uses a tool called useParams to read the ID from the URL and show data like:
“Feature data for ID: 101”.
