I created a user-friendly feedback form with a header, navigation, form, media embedding, and footer to enhance the user experience.

Key Features:
I used semantic HTML for better structure.
The form includes fields for name, email, satisfaction level, preferred feature, and comments to gather user feedback.
I embedded a video tutorial and an audio clip to make the experience more engaging.

Challenges & Solutions:
I faced some layout issues, but I fixed them by properly labeling inputs and using CSS for better alignment.
While embedding media, I used placeholder links and added fallback text for browsers that donâ€™t support them.

Future Enhancements:
I plan to replace the placeholder video and audio with real content.
I will improve the styling using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
To make the form more accessible, I will add ARIA labels.
This project helped me understand how to create an interactive and accessible feedback form!
