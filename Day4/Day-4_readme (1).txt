I revamped the LaunchDarkly employee portalâ€™s feedback form page by creating a responsive, flexible design using CSS Flexbox and media queries. This design ensures the form looks great on both desktop and mobile devices, delivering a clean, modern, and user-friendly experience.

Key Features:

I used semantic HTML and CSS Flexbox to structure the page with a header, navigation, feedback form, and footer.
I arranged the feedback form using Flexbox, placing the name, email, satisfaction radio buttons, feature dropdown, and comments textarea in a vertical column with a consistent 15px gap.
I centered the form horizontally with justify-content: center; and aligned the form content at the top using align-items: flex-start;.
The submit button is pushed to the bottom of the form using margin-top: auto; and centered for easy access.
Media queries adjust the layout on screens smaller than 768px by setting the container to 90% width, stacking elements vertically, and increasing spacing for touch-friendly interactions.
Challenges & Solutions:

Balancing vertical spacing between the header and the form while keeping the content aligned at the top was a challenge. I solved this by fine-tuning the Flexbox alignment properties on both the body and the form container.
Ensuring a flexible, visually appealing layout on various devices required iterative adjustments in the media queries.
I also addressed cross-browser consistency by thoroughly testing and refining the CSS properties.
Future Enhancements:

I plan to incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user interactions.
I aim to further optimize the design for tablets and other devices with refined media queries.
I will explore integrating a CSS framework like Bootstrap to streamline styling and maintain consistency.
To boost accessibility, I intend to add ARIA labels and enhance focus states for form elements.
This project deepened my understanding of CSS Flexbox and responsive design, demonstrating my ability to create modern, flexible layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
