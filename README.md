# Web_Development_Crash_Course_Day_1_Assignment




I structured the page with a clear HTML layout, starting with <!DOCTYPE html> to define it as an HTML5 document. In the <head> section, I included essential meta tags for encoding and responsiveness. I also set the <title> as "Welcome to LaunchDarkly."

For the content, I used semantic HTML elements to maintain clarity. I added an <h1> for the main heading and <h2> subheadings  for sections like "Our Mission and Values" and "Core Values." I wrote a brief description of LaunchDarklyâ€™s mission using a <p> tag and listed its core values (Innovation, Collaboration, and User-First Mindset) using a <ul> with <li> elements. I also included a hyperlink (<a>) to the homepage and an image (<img>) with alt text for accessibility.

One of the challenges I faced was finding a suitable image, so I used a placeholder (https://via.placeholder.com/150). Initially, I also used # as a temporary link for the homepage but later updated it. I ensured proper indentation and added comments to improve readability.

This project helped me practice structuring an HTML document while following best practices. It serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced web pages in the future.
