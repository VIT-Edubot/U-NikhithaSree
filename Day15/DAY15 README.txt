Responsive Webpage with Tailwind CSS
This project is a simple responsive webpage built using Tailwind CSS. It contains a header with a logo and navigation links, a main content section with a title, paragraph, and button, and a footer at the bottom of the page. The entire layout is styled using Tailwind's utility classes to ensure a clean and responsive design.

How Tailwind CSS Was Installed and Used
Tailwind CSS was installed using npm with version 3. After setting up the configuration file, Tailwind's utility classes were applied directly in the HTML/JSX files. The configuration included specifying file paths for content scanning and importing the Tailwind directives into the main CSS file to generate the final styles.

How the Page Was Styled
Header: Flexbox was used for layout with spacing and alignment utilities. The background was styled with a dark shade, and padding was added for spacing. Responsiveness was handled using media queries to stack or align navigation links based on screen size.

Main Content: Typography utilities were used for the title and paragraph. Padding and margin utilities were used for spacing. A styled button was added with background color, text color, padding, rounded corners, and a hover effect.

Footer: Positioned at the bottom of the page with center-aligned small text. The layout is responsive across all screen sizes.

Responsiveness: Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities like sm:, md:, and lg: were used to adjust layouts for different screen sizes, ensuring a mobile-friendly design.

Polish (Bonus): Hover animations were added to the navbar links, and layout widths were adjusted for larger screens using utility classes like max-w-7xl and mx-auto.
