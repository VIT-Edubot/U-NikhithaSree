III. Prompt : what is the importance of heading tags and how they are used?
Response: 
Certainly!

Importance of Heading Tags
Heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) are crucial in HTML for several reasons:

Content Hierarchy and Structure:

Headings establish a clear outline of the content. <h1> represents the main heading, and <h2> to <h6> denote subheadings, creating a nested structure.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization):

Search engines use headings to understand the content's structure and importance. Proper use of headings can improve the visibility of your page in search results.
Accessibility:

Screen readers and other assistive technologies use headings to provide a better navigation experience for users with disabilities.
Styling:

Headings come with default styles that make the text stand out. They can be further styled using CSS to fit the design of the page.

IV. Prompt : How do I add a list of core values in HTML?  
Response: 
To add a list of core values in HTML, you can use the unordered list (<ul>) or ordered list (<ol>) elements, depending on whether the order of the values matters or not.

Using Unordered List
If the order of core values does not matter, use an unordered list:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Core Values</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Our Core Values</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrity</li>
        <li>Innovation</li>
        <li>Respect</li>
        <li>Teamwork</li>
        <li>Customer Focus</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
Explanation
<ul>: Defines an unordered list.
<ol>: Defines an ordered list.
<li>: Defines a list item within either an unordered or an ordered list.
You can place either list after an appropriate heading to create a clear and structured display of your core values on the web page.
