In this assignment, I focused on improving the feedback form using CSS styling for better layout, readability, and responsiveness.

I created a styles.css file and linked it to the HTML. I used a light grey background (#f8f9fa), modern fonts, and styled headings (<h1>, <h2>) with different sizes and colors to enhance clarity. The form container was centered with a white background, border, and box-shadow for a clean look. Input fields were styled as block elements, while radio buttons and the dropdown were aligned inline.

For user interaction, I added a green submit button (#28a745) with a hover effect. I also used media queries to make the form responsive, ensuring elements stack properly on smaller screens.

One challenge was spacing issues with form inputs, which I fixed by adding padding. Making the form fully responsive was another challenge, which I solved by adjusting widths and flex properties.

Overall, this assignment helped me improve my CSS layout skills, making the form more user-friendly and visually appealing.
